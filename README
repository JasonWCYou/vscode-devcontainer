# VS Code Dev Container

In this repository you will find several configuration files to use Dev Containers (base on Docker) in VS Code.

## Usage

1. Follow the instructions in [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started) to set up the softwares.
2. For each project, choose a matched configuration and copy everything in the template folder to the root of your project (most likely will include a `.devcontainer/` folder and a `Dockerfile`, may have other necessary files). 
3. Make modifications if needed.
4. Open the project in VS Code and it will prompt you to reopen the project in the container (or you can click the button at the bottom left corner to reopen it in the container).
5. All done! Good to go!

## Configurations

- [x] Tensorflow 2.0 with GPU support
- [ ] React.js / Next.js (not decided yet)

## Notes

If you find any problems or have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue. Thanks!

**BTW** I'm not a Docker expert or a VS Code expert, and I can be lazy sometimes, so if you find there are no updates for a long time, please feel free to remind me. Thanks again!
